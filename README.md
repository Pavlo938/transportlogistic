# transportlogistic
Transport-logistic app
Create a PoC solution for a transport logistic company. The user should be able to CRUD Locations, Routes and view Route Plans, automatically generated by the solution.
For simplicity each Location has (x, y) pair of coordinates, the Earth is flat, and we live in a Wonderland where each city is connected with all the others.
We expect a high load. So the performance of the Route Plan generation should not influence the performance of other calls to the API.
